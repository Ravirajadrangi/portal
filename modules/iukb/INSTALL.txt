Install this module as you would any other. Uncompress the tarball and move the
resulting directory into the /modules/ directory of your choice. Enable the
module under /admin/build/modules. Set the permissions to your requirements at
/admin/user/permissions. Allow 'access iukb' if you want a role to be able to
use the /kb/ URLs. Currently, administer iukb has no purpose. A future version
should include an administration page where one can change the SOAP key used
in fetching articles through the SOAP KB API. The module also includes two
input filters. These must be manually enabled for each format desired. (Check
the box next to IUKB Link Translation while configuring the input filters on
this page: /admin/settings/filters/list) Once IUKB Link Translation is turned
on, configure the filter and enable either/both Encode <a> links to kb.iu.edu
or/and Encode [iukb:xxxx] to a local page.
